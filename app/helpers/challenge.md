Front-End Developer Position
InVision - JavaScript Challenge

Prepared by Yehuda Katz
In this exercise, you will build a simple tab control for use in the browser environment. You may use jQuery and any browser APIs, but you may not use any other libraries, including jQuery UI.
The control must:
Have any number of visible tabs
Only one tab at a time may be active
When active, a tab has a distinct visual appearance
One tab should be active initially, and the specific tab may be customized in the markup
When a tab is active, its associated pane should be visible
No other panes should be visible
All content should appear in the markup. JavaScript should be used to control behavior only
You should write tests for the control, using a test framework of your choosing. Two good test frameworks are QUnit and Jasmine, but any test framework will do.
For bonus points:
You can register for a custom event when the active tab is changed
A tab can receive its contents via Ajax, specified in the markup
The structure of the tabs control works conceptually without JavaScript
If anything is unclear about these instructions, feel free to improvise!
Once you’ve completed the challenge commit your code to a GitHub repo to submit your work to clark@invisionapp.com.  Please also include your PayPal ID so we can send payment right away.
