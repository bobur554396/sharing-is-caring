        Century of the Self is an award-winning British television documentary series
        by Adam Curtis. It focuses on how the work of Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud, and
        Edward Bernays influenced the way corporations and governments have analyzed,\u202d
        dealt with, and controlled \u202cpeople. This series is banned on YouTube
        because of the secrets it contains.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\"This series is
        about how those in power have used Freud''s theories to try and control the
        dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy.\" \u2014Adam Curtis'' introduction
        to the first episode.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis,
        changed the perception of the human mind and its workings. The series describes
        the propaganda that Western governments and corporations have utilized stemming
        from Freud''s theories.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFreud himself and his nephew
        Edward Bernays, who was the first to use psychological techniques in public
        relations, are discussed. Freud''s daughter Anna Freud, a pioneer of child
        psychology, is mentioned in the second part, as is one of the main opponents
        of Freud''s theories, Wilhelm Reich, in the third part.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAlong
        these general themes, The Century of the Self asks deeper questions about
        the roots and methods of modern consumerism, representative democracy, commodification
        and its implications. It also questions the modern way we see ourselves, the
        attitudes to fashion and superficiality.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe business
        and political world uses psychological techniques to read, create and fulfill
        our desires, to make their products or speeches as pleasing as possible to
        us. Curtis raises the question of the intentions and roots of this fact. Where
        once the political process was about engaging people''s rational, conscious
        minds, as well as facilitating their needs as a society, the documentary shows
        how by employing the tactics of psychoanalysis, politicians appeal to irrational,
        primitive impulses that have little apparent bearing on issues outside of
        the narrow self-interest of a consumer population.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPaul
        Mazur, a leading Wall Street banker working for Lehman Brothers, is cited
        as declaring: \"We must shift America from a needs- to a desires-culture.
        People must be trained to desire, to want new things, even before the old
        have been entirely consumed. [...] Man''s desires must overshadow his needs\".<br
        \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn Episode 4 the main subjects are Philip Gould and Matthew
        Freud, the great-grandson of Sigmund, a PR consultant. They were part of the
        efforts during the nineties to bring the Democrats in the US and New Labour
        in the United Kingdom back into power. Adam Curtis explores the psychological
        methods they have now massively introduced into politics. He also argues that
        the eventual outcome strongly resembles Edward Bernays vision for the \"Democracity\"
        during the 1939 New York World''s Fair.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt is widely
        believed that the series was inspired and informed by a book written by the
        American historian, Stuart Ewen, \"PR! A Social History of Spin\".","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/67977038","upload_date":"2013-06-09
